About Us!
######
Thank you for choosing CyberBlue, so we feel that you deserve to know a little bit about us!
######
We are Reid (dodger) and Nolan (galactic)
######
We feel that some discord bots, well, charge too much! That is why we started the CyberBlue bot, in a mission to make an actual good discord bot that doesn't have any features behind a stupid paywall!
######
The only things that will cost money are so small we can list them on this page!

That's it! Were you expecting some sort of premium thing?! Haha, never!
######
Back on track anyway lol
######
We both have a knack for coding, and do it on a daily basis
######
    Reid knows batch, python, java, javascript, C++, lua, C#, C, CSS. Talk about knowing some languages!
######
    I (Nolan) know a little less, but still something! I know lua, python, batch, and a tiny bit of Java
######
We are both, what you would call, a script kiddie (basically nerds). 
######
Well anyway thats about it for the about us! I hope you have a very good time with CyberBlue!

    Cheers, the CyberBlue team!
